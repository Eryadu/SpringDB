A ServiceRegistry interface, in the context of distributed systems and microservices, acts as a central location 
for services to register themselves and for other services to discover them. It's a directory or lookup table where 
microservices can declare their existence and details (like endpoints, protocols, and versions). This allows services 
to communicate and interact with each other without having to know their specific, hardcoded locations or addresses.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

Purpose:
-- Service Discovery:
   The main purpose of a service registry is to enable services to discover each other. A service can register 
   itself with the registry, providing information about its capabilities and location. Then, other services can query 
   the registry to find the specific services they need to interact with.
-- Centralized Information:
   Service registries act as a central repository for service information, making it easy for other components 
   in the system to locate and use them.
-- Loose Coupling:
   By leveraging a service registry, services become loosely coupled. They don't need to know the hardcoded addresses 
   of other services, making them more flexible and maintainable.
-- Scalability:
   Service registries can be used to manage a large number of services, making it easier to scale distributed systems.

## Key Features:
-- Registration:
   Services register themselves with the registry, providing information about their capabilities, location, and versions.
-- Lookup:
   Other services can query the registry to find the services they need to interact with.
-- Updates and De-registration:
   Services can update their information in the registry or de-register themselves when they are no longer available.

   retrieve objects from the Service Registry. The ServiceRegistry interface is available via a Stateless Session Bean.
